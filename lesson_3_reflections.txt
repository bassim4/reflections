When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I am working with other contributers on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might be in the middle of a chenge and pulling the repository at this point will not make any good.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forke: will copy a repo within github server.
Colne: will copy a repo from server to local machine.
Branch: is a branch from a commit you choose.
